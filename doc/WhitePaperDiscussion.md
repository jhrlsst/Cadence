# Supernova Cosmology and Astrophysics

## Science Goals of Supernovae

* Supernova Cosmology: Use a sample of well-measured supernovae and past knowledge of supernovae behavior to obtain intrinsic brightnesses of supernovae and derive constraints on cosmology, particularly dark energy properties
* Related: Improvement of our understanding of the supernovae population. This 
includes understanding the distribution of SN properties in nature, and their correlation with their environments (host-galaxy properties, progenitor stars 
etc.)
* Use SN to study large scale structure, or deviations of the cosmology from 
FRW or certain galaxy populations. Largely, this is achieved by using SN as tracers of their host galaxies with the additional information about their distances being  well-measured.


- The most important goal from the supernova perspective is characterization of the light curve
- This is important for classification of SN, as well as studying SN as distance indicators
